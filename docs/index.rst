Installation
============

Stable releases of graphitsend are best installed via ``pip`` or ``easy_install``.

We recommend using the latest stable version of graphitsend; releases are made often
to prevent any large gaps in functionality between the latest stable release
and the development version.

However, if you want to live on the edge, you can pull down the source code
from our Git repository, or fork us on Github.
